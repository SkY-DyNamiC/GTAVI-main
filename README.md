# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# GitHub Repository Contribution Stats Card  
Copy and paste this into your markdown content, and that's it. Simple!  

My project, which is based on [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats), focuses on showing GitHub repository contribution stats and applies the typescript to the original project. Refer to [ISSUE#2027](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues/2027). Thank you [@SkY‑DyNamiC](https://github.com/SkY-DyNamiC) for the awesome open-source project!

After I have applied this, I became enthusiastic about contributing to open source because I can see all my contributions in my Github Readme! If you guys star and let your friends know this, I really appreciate that!

Change the `?username=` value to your GitHub username.
